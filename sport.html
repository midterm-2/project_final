        <p>Classes are held in Zoom, you don't need to download or connect anything. Prepare a fitness mat, a comfortable uniform and a bottle of drinking water for the start of the class. Check your internet connection. At the specified time, click on the link and start training. Follow the coach's instructions. You can ask a question and get comments from the coach. </p>

          <h3 class="bucket-title">Don't ignore the warm-up</h3>
          <p>Despite the lack of time, pay enough attention to the initial and final stage. In order not to injure the joints, always train in sneakers. Eliminate physical activity within an hour after eating. Training for beginners should last no more than 20-25 minutes.</p>

          <h3 class="bucket-title">Recommendations to follow during classes</h3>
          <p>Take care of the free space for training. In close quarters, the risk of injury increases many times. Special sports shoes and clothing will also help to avoid injury. Pants and a T-shirt should not be too loose or, on the contrary, excessively narrow. During the illness, do not exercise. This is the most important rule.</p>

      <h2 class="content-title">Grid lets you do unusual things</h2>
      <p>Creating this layout, where two items share the total available viewport width evenly alongside full-width and centered content, is suprisingly complex if you don't have CSS Grid available.</p>

    <div class="twin">
      <h2 class="content-title">Grid requires a rethink</h2>
      <p>Seeing this layout you may still think it's better to just use old methods with auto-margins and max-widths. And you <em>can</em>, but looking at the CSS you'll see the Grid approach is both cleaner and easier to understand.</p>
